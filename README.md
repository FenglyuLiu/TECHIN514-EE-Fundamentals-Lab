# TECHIN514-EE-Fundamentals-Lab

To complete the assignment:

Generate the BOM spreadsheet using KiCAD;
Reading the devices' datasheet and calculating the UNKNOWN values on the datasheet, then fill them in;
Assemble the board with your chosen resistor values;
Verify the voltage output with the multimeter, and then attach your ESP32 to the outputs and read the voltage using an analog input pin;
Submit a single PDF file containing:
Your selected resistors and the calculations you made
Please be verbose about how you did the calculation and what essential information you found from the datasheet
Screenshot of the exported BOM spreadsheet, with values filled in
A picture of your board
Link to GitHub repo of your ESP32 code
Screenshot of the serial output from your ESP32 (zeros are okay if you get a non-functioning board)
